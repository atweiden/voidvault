# 18. Shouldn't xscreensaver disable Ctrl-Alt-Backspace while the screen is
# locked?
#
# Yes, it should. Unfortunately, that's not possible with current versions of
# XFree86 or XOrg. It's as if the developers of X11 and the Linux kernel want
# to make it as hard as possible for you to lock your screen.
#
# Backdoor #1: Ctrl-Alt-Backspace.
#
#     This keystroke kills the X server, and on some systems, leaves you at a
#     text console. If the user launched X11 manually, that text console will
#     still be logged in. To disable this keystroke globally and permanently,
#     you need to set the DontZap flag in your xorg.conf or XF86Config or
#     XF86Config-4 file (whichever name is in use on your system). See the
#     manual for XF86Config (or variant) for more details.
#
# Backdoor #2: Ctrl-Alt-F1, Ctrl-Alt-F2, etc.
#
#     These keystrokes will switch to a different virtual console, while
#     leaving the console that X11 is running on locked. If you left a shell
#     logged in on another virtual console, it is unprotected. So don't leave
#     yourself logged in on other consoles. You can disable VT switching
#     globally and permanently by setting DontVTSwitch in your xorg.conf, but
#     that might make your system harder to use.
#
# Backdoor #3: Alt-SysRq-F.
#
#     This is the Linux kernel "OOM-killer" keystroke. It shoots down random
#     long-running programs of its choosing, and so might might target and
#     kill xscreensaver, and there's no way for xscreensaver to protect
#     itself from that. You can disable it globally with: sudo 'echo 0 >
#     /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq'
#
# Backdoor #4: Ctrl-Alt-KP_Multiply.
#
#     This keystroke kills any X11 app that holds a lock, so typing this
#     will kill xscreensaver and unlock the screen. This "feature" showed
#     up in the X server in 2008, and as of 2011, some vendors are shipping
#     it turned on by default. How nice. You can disable it by turning off
#     AllowClosedownGrabs in xorg.conf.

# This is redundant, but makes me _feel_ safer
